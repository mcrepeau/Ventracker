# Ventracker
Ventracker is an unofficial app for the Ventra public transportation system in Chicago. It lets you enter your Ventra card information and displays the remaining balance on your card and/or the time left on your Ventra pass.

The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology enables you to take advantage of the contactless functionality of your Ventra pass to read the card information so you don't have to enter it manually (dependent upon support by your smartphone).

With Ventracker, you can memorize and keep track of up to 8 Ventra cards and get notifications whenever the remaining balance is too low before you get to the CTA station or on the bus. This convenient app can check the balance of your cards in the background at regularly intervals and alert you in advance when it is time to add value or a pass to your Ventra card.
